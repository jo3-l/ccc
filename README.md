## What is this?

This is a repository for my solutions to CCC problem sets in past years.<br>
Most/all code is in Python 3, though if time permits I'll write some solutions in other languages too.<br>
Solutions are tested using [DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/).

## Progress

_A checked box indicates there is a full solution getting full points, while an empty box means either the problem was not solved / the solution is incomplete._

### CCC '20

-   [x] [J1: Dog Treats](./2020/j1.py)
-   [x] [J2: Epidemiology](./2020/j2.py)
-   [x] [J3: Art](./2020/j3.py)
-   [x] [J4: Cyclic Shifts](./2020/j4.py)
-   [x] [J5: Escape Room](./2020/J5.java)
    -   The Java solution gets full points (15/15) while the Python solution TLEs on the last batch (13/15).
